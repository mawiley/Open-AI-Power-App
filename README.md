# Open AI Power App
This is a Power App I'm using to test out Open AI endpoints and configuration. I'll continue to add more scenarios.

## Configuring Open AI Connector
I created a custom connector from the following source (built by Robin RosengrÃ¼n). The published version inside Power Platform didn't have the image generation endpoint published yet.

You also need an API key from openai.com.
> Format for API key when you create the connector is: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" (the word "Bearer" a blank and the actual API_KEY)
